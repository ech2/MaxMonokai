Monokai color scheme for Max
=================

A port of Monokai color theme for [Max/MSP](http://cycling74.com/products/max/).

## Motivation

I often work at night or in dark rooms, where eyes quickly become tired if working with light interface colors. Unfortunately, every dark color scheme bundled with Max feels uncompleted and/or looks ugly. For example, **Noir** theme matches my needs very closely, but it is too dark for my personal taste and doesn't style many UI common objects (`multislider`, `spectroscope~`, `live.*` objects, etc.).  

To not reinvent the wheel, I decided to port a Monokai color scheme on Max. I themed everything in the `Object Defaults` window, including Max4Live and [Jamoma](http://jamoma.org/) objects. Watch at the screenshot to see how awesome Max/MSP looks with Monokai color theme:

## Installtaion

Just clone the repository to the `Max 6.1/packages` dir.

## Usage

Click `Load Settings` button in `Menu > Options > Object Defaults...` and choose `MaxMonokai` color scheme.
